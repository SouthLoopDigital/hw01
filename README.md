# Introduction: Rob Warmowski

BIO: A Linux systems admin, writer, consultant and sometime script-writing generalist, Rob is a digital native of some years. He is nursing a growing interest in data journalism and a deepening appreciation for the avocation of *counting interesting things*. Rob is following along with the CFSS class syllabus from afar. As a newb in Git, he isn't even sure if his pull request will make it to the class's Github repo, but suspects it might.  In any event, as he is not an enrolled student, his contributions are not to be graded.  *Which is probably lucky for him.*
